## WDD 330 - Web Frontend Development II FINAL PROJECT

 - Exchange rates between currencies fluctuate constantly, and many people need a
    quick and reliable way to convert values between different currencies. The
    purpose of this web-based application is to bring up-to-date exchange rates to the
    users, perform conversions, and provide statistics for currency data.
    The motivation behind this project is the need to convert currencies while working
    with foreign payments and provide an easy way for users to do so.
